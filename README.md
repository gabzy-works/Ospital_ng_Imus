# Ospital ng Imus Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Database Setup (MariaDB)

This project now uses MariaDB as the database backend. Follow these steps to set up the database:

### Prerequisites
- MariaDB Server installed and running
- Python packages: `mysql-connector-python`, `python-dotenv`

### Database Configuration

1. **Create the database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hospital_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   ```

2. **Import the schema:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p hospital_db < hospital_schema.sql
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Copy the `.env` file and update the database credentials:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   DB_NAME=hospital_db
   ```

### Database Features
- **Patients Table**: Stores patient information with medical history
- **Appointments Table**: Manages patient appointments
- **Imports Table**: Tracks data import history
- **Indexes**: Optimized for fast searches
- **Views**: Pre-built queries for common operations

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

### Frontend Setup

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

### Backend Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask mysql-connector-python python-dotenv werkzeug
   ```

2. Set up the database (see Database Setup section above)

3. Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The backend will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Full System
- Frontend (React): http://localhost:5173
- Backend (Flask): http://localhost:5000
- Database: MariaDB on localhost:3306

If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```
